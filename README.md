# BioPass
**Never remember a password again, make your face do it!**

## The Project
  * A web hosted password manager that does not store passwords in anyway (plaintext, hash or encrypted)
  * Passwords are generated through a users unique biometric - currently facial recognition but could be fingerprint in mobile version
  * Focus on creating a frictionless authentication process to promote use of password managers, reducing human risk
